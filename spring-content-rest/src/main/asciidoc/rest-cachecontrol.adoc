== Cache Control

By using cache control headers effectively, we can instruct the 
browser to cache resources and avoid network hops. This decreases 
latency, and also the load on our applications.

Spring Content REST allows us to control these headers by configuring 
a set of cache control rules applied, in the order they are defined, 
to all GET requests for content.

One, or more, rules can be configured as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
class CustomContentRestMvcConfiguration {

   @Bean
   public ContentRestConfigurer configurer() {

       return new ContentRestConfigurer() {
           @Override
           public void configure(RestConfiguration config) {
               config
                   .cacheControl()
                       .antMatcher("/testEntities/*", CacheControl.maxAge(Duration.ofSeconds(60)));
           }
       };
   }
}
