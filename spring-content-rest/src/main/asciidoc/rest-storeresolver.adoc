== Store Resolver
Every REST request must map to one store and one store only.  However, it is entirely possible to define an application
with multiple stores that make this impossible.

For these situations you need to provide a `StoreResolver` that, based on runtime context, can resolve these conflicts.

.Configuring a StoreResolver
====
[source, java]
----
public interface S3ExampleStore extends S3ContentStore<Example, UUID>{}
public interface FSExampleStore extends FilesystemContentStore<Example, UUID>{}     <1>

@Configuration
@EnableS3Stores
@EnableFilesystemStores
public static class ApplicationConfig {

    @Bean
    public ContentRestConfigurer contentRestConfigurer() {
        return new ContentRestConfigurer() {
            @Override
            public void configure(RestConfiguration config) {
                config.addStoreResolver("examples", new StoreResolver() {           <2>
                    @Override
                    public StoreInfo resolve(StoreInfo... stores) {
                        /* your resolver implementation */
                    }
                });
            }
        };
    }
}
----
<1> Both stores are typed to the domain type `Example` and will therefore be exported to the URI `/examples`
<2> Store resolver resolves requests to `/examples/...` to either S3ExamplesStore or FSExampleStore, depending
on request context.
