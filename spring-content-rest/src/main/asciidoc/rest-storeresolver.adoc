== Store Resolver
Every REST request must map to one store and one store only.  However, it is entirely possible to define an application
with multiple stores that make this impossible.

For these situations you need to provide a `StoreResolver` that, based on runtime context, can resolve these conflicts.

.Configuring a StoreResolver
====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableS3Stores
public static class ApplicationConfig {

    @Bean
    public ContentRestConfigurer contentRestConfigurer() {
        return new ContentRestConfigurer() {
            @Override
            public void configure(RestConfiguration config) {
                config.addStoreResolver("examples", new StoreResolver() {           <1>
                    @Override
                    public StoreInfo resolve(StoreInfo... stores) {
                        /* your resolver implementation */
                    }
                });
            }
        };
    }
}
